# 1.1 Basic Computing Concepts

## Algorithim

Step-by-step description of how to accomplish a task.

## Program 

List of instructions to be carried out by a computer.

## Digital 

Based on numbers that increase in discrete increments, such as the intergets 0, 1, 2, etc. 

## Binary Number

A number composed of just os and 1s, also known as a base-2 number.
| Decimal | Binary | 
| -------- | ------- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 11 |
| 4 | 100 |
| 5 | 101 |
| 6 | 110 |
| 7 | 111 |
| 8 | 1000 |

## Program Execution

The act of carrying out the instructions contained in a program.

## Compiler

A program that translates a computer program written in our language into an equivalent program into another language. (High level -> machine commonly)

## Java Virtual Machine

A theoretical computer whose machine language is the set of Java bytecodes. 

## Java Runtime 

A program that executres compiled Java bytecodes.

## Java Class Libraries

The collection of preexisting Java code that provides solutions to common programming problems. 

`Hello.java`
```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

## Example Execution

### Step 1 

Write Source File & Output `Hello.java`.

### Step 2

Submit source to Compiler 

**If failure, return to Step 1!**

**If success:**

Output `Hello.class` 

### Step 3

Execute Class file
