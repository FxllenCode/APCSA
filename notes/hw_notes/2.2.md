# 2.2 Variables 

## Variable

A memory location with a name and a type that stores a value.

```java
public class BMICalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // declare variables
        double height;
        double weight;
        double bmi;

        // compute BMI
        height = 70;
        weight = 195;
        bmi = weight / (height * height) * 703;

        // print results
        System.out.println("Current BMI " + bmi);
    }
}
```

## Declaration

A request to set aside a new variable with a given name and type.

ex: `double height;`

## Assignment

Setting the value of a variable.

ex: `height = 5.5;`

## Compound

`double height = 5.5;`

## String Concatenation

Combining several strings into a single string, or combining a string with other data into a new longer string.

`x = x + 1;` is the same as `x++;`

`x = x*5` is the same as `x*=5;`

## Promote

`double y = 2;`

`2` is an int, but Java promotes it to a double to fit in the variable.

`int x = 3.5;` is an error because Java cannot fit a double into an int.
`int x = (int)3.5;` is a legal cast, which is a way to force Java to fit a double into an int.
