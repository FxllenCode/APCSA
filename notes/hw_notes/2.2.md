# 2.2 Variables 

## Variable

A memory location with a name and a type that stores a value.

```java
public class BMICalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // declare variables
        double height;
        double weight;
        double bmi;

        // compute BMI
        height = 70;
        weight = 195;
        bmi = weight / (height * height) * 703;

        // print results
        System.out.println("Current BMI " + bmi);
    }
}
```

## Declaration

A request to set aside a new variable with a given name and type.

ex: `double height;`

## Assignment

Setting the value of a variable.

ex: `height = 5.5;`

## Compound

`double height = 5.5;`

## String Concatenation

Combining several strings into a single string, or combining a string with other data into a new longer string.

`x = x + 1;` is the same as `x++;`

`x = x*5` is the same as `x*=5;`

## Promote

`double y = 2;`

`2` is an int, but Java promotes it to a double to fit in the variable.

`int x = 3.5;` is an error because Java cannot fit a double into an int.
`int x = (int)3.5;` is a legal cast, which is a way to force Java to fit a double into an int.

## Declare multiple variables of the same type

Ex `double height, weight;` <br>
Ex `double height = 70, weight = 195, bmi;`

`=` is an operator that evaluates the same as the vale assigned and associates right to left. 
<br>
So... `int x, y, z;`

```
* x = y = z = 2 * 5 + 4;
:) x = (y = (z = 2 * 5 + 4));

both * and :) have the result of assigning 14 to each of x, y, and z.
```

## String Concatenation (again)

Combining several strings into a single string, or combining a string with other data into a new longer string.

```java
public class Time {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int hours = 365 * 24;
        int minutes = hours * 60;
        int seconds = minutes * 60;
        System.out.println("Hours in a year = " + hours);
        System.out.println("Minutes in a year = " + minutes);
        System.out.println("Seconds in a year = " + seconds);
    }
}
``` 
**More examples**

```
2 + 3 + " hello " + 7 + 2 * 3
2 + 3 + " hello " + 7 + 6
5 + " hello " + 7 + 6
"5 hello " + 7 + 6
"5 hello 7" + 6
"5 hello 76"
```

## Increment/Decrement Operators

`x += 1;` is the same as `x = x + 1;` <br>
`y = y % 5` is the same as `y %= 5;` <br>

Works for other arithmetic operators `-` `/` and `*`. <br>
The more compact += is known as shorthand.

### Operator Precendence


| Operator | Precedence |
| --- | --- |
| Unary | `++`, `--`, `+`, `-` |
| Multiplicative | `*`, `/`, `%` |
| Additive | `+`, `-` |
| Assignment | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` |

Can tell unary if only 1 operand. Used to say + 6.2. 

<!-- I do not know what this means -->

```
int x = 3;
int y;

y = x++
y = ++x
```

In both cases, x becauses for. Post increment `x++` evaluates to 3. Pre increment `++x` evaluates to 4.
