# 2.4 Managing Complexity

## Scope

The part of a program in which a particular declaration is valid.
<br>
Scope of ...

`...` a static method - the classs where it is defined
<br>
`...` a variable - from its declaration to the brace


## Local Variable

A variable declared inside a method that is accessible only within that method.

## Localizing Variables

Declaring variables in the most local scope possible

## Infinite Loop

A loop that never terminates.

    write 9-2*i asterisks
    go to new line

| i | line | spaces | asterisks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 9 |
| 1 | 2 | 1 | 7 |
| 2 | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 4 | 1 |
| i | i + 1 | i | 9 - 2 * i |

```java
public class IdrawV {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            for(int j = 0; j < 9 - 2 * i; j++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

The 5 in the for loop is a "magic number", one that seems to make hte program work but whose purpose is not obvious. Can be replaced with:

`public static final int LINES = 5;` < -- above main
`for(int i = 0; i < LINES; i++) {` < -- in loop

## Class Constant

A named variable that cannot be changed (keyword final). **EX. LINES**
