# 1.4 Procedural Decomposition

## Decomposition

A seperation into discernible parts, each simpler than the whole.

*Cake example* - A cake is made up of many ingredients. Each ingredient is a part of the cake. The cake is the whole. There are also different steps to making the cake. Each step is a part of the process of making the cake. The process of making the cake is the whole.

## Iterative Enhancement

The process of producing a program in stages, adding new functionality at each stage. A key feature of each step is that you can test it to make sure it works before moving on.

## Static Method

A block of java programs that is given a name. 

### Syntax Template

```java
public static void <name> () {
    <statement>;
    <statement>;
    ...
    <statement>;
}
```

### Explanation 

* `public` - Method available for use by all parts of program.
* `static` - Method is not associated with any particular object.
* `void` - Method does not return a value.
* `<name>` - Name of method.
* `()` - Empty parentheses indicate that method does not take any parameters.

## Method Call

A command to execute another method, which causes all the statements inside that method to be executed. 

## Flow of Control 

The order in which statements are executed.

## Example

```java
public class DrawBoxes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("+------+");
        System.out.println("|      |");
        System.out.println("|      |");
        System.out.println("+------+");
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("+------+");
        System.out.println("|      |");
        System.out.println("|      |");
        System.out.println("+------+");
    }
}

public class DrawBoxes2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        drawBox();
        System.out.println();
        drawBox();
    }

    public static void drawBox() {
        System.out.println("+------+");
        System.out.println("|      |");
        System.out.println("|      |");
        System.out.println("+------+");
    }
}
```
