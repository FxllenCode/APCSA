# 1.2 And Now - Java

## Class

A unit of code that is the basic building block of Java programs. File name must match the class name.

### **Syntax Template: Class**

```java
public class <name> {
    <method>
    <method>
    ...
    <method>
}

```

## Method

A program unit that represents a particular action or computation. 

### **Syntax Template: Method**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    <statement>;
    <statement>;
    ...
    <statement>;
}
```

## Statement

An execitable snippet of code that represents a complete command. 

### String Literal 

"Text on just one line surrounded by double quotes"

'very bad'
"cannot be on <br/><br/>two lines"

### Example

`example.java`
```java
System.out.println();
System.out.println("a line");
System.out.println();
System.out.println("b line");
System.out.println("c line");
```
`Output`
```

a line

b line
c line
```

## Common Escape Sequences

`\t` - Tab
`\n` - New line
`\"` - Quotation mark
`\\` - Backslash 

### Example 

```java
System.out.println("What \" does\" this \\ print?");
```
`Output`
```
What "does" this \ print?
``` 


## Print vs. Println

### Example

```java
System.out.print("To be");
System.out.print("or not to be. ");
System.out.print("That is ");
System.out.println("the question.");
System.out.print("This is ");
System.out.println("for the whole family!");
```
`Output`

```
To be or not to be. That is the question.
This is for the whole family!
```

## Identifiers and Keywords

### Identifier

A name given to an entity in a program such as a class or a method.

**RULES**

* Must start with a letter
* _ and $ are letters
* May contain any numer of letters and digits
* Cannot be a reserved word

**CONVENTIONS**

`AllMyChildren` <-- Class name (PascalCase) <br>
`allMyChildren` <-- Variable & Method name (camelCase) <br>
`ALL_MY_CHILDREN` <-- Constant name (LOUD_SNAKE_CASE) <br>

### Reserved Keywords

* abstract
* assert
* boolean
* break
* byte
* case
* catch
* char
* class
* const
* continue
* default
* do
* double
* else
* enum
* extends
* final
* finally
* float
* for
* goto
* if
* implements
* import
* instanceof
* int
* interface
* long
* native
* new
* package
* private
* protected
* public
* return
* short
* static
* strictfp
* super
* switch
* synchronized
* this
* throw
* throws
* transient
* try
* void
* volatile
* while

## Comments and Readability

### Bad Example

```java
public class Ugly {public static void main(String[] args) {System.out.println("How short I am!");}}
```

### Readability Rules

* Class and Method headers on lines by themselves
* No more than one statement per line
* Indent properly. When an opening brace appears, increase the indentation of the lines that follow it. When a closing brace appears, reduce the indentation. 
* Use one tab for indentation.
* Use blank lines to seperate parts of the program. 

### Proper Example

```java
public class Ugly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("How short I am!");
    }
}
```

### Comments

Text that programmers include to explain their code.

* Single line comments start with `//`
* Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`
